# Resource

Reading data from package contents and files.

## Features and bugs

The current version of `resource.dart` depends on the `dart:io` library,
and doesn't work in the browser.
Use `package:resource/browser_resource.dart` in the browser until
further notice.

Please file feature requests and bugs at the [issue tracker][tracker].
